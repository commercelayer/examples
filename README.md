This repository contains example code demos that are not production-ready in most cases. We do not encourage you to use the code directly for production development but you can build on them to develop your own ecommerce applications or integrations. Our goal here is to provide you with different reference code (accompanied by tutorials) that will show you different ways you can build with Commerce Layer. We will constantly add new examples and accept more from our amazing community members, so check back often :).

Here are the parent categories of the examples in this repository:

- [Authentication](/authentication) — Different ways to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) or single sign-on authentication (SSO) with Commerce Layer.
- [CMS](/cms) — Implementation of multi-market ecommerce web stores with top content management systems.
