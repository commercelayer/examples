# access-token-sandbox

This example shows a code implementation of how to generate an access token with [commercelayer-js-auth](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-js-auth) library and decode JWT access tokens using [jwt-decode](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode). To get started, kindly read [this comprehensive guide](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/authentication) on our documentation.
